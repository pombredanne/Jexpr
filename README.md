[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vrhmd31v1g86avo8/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ziyasal/jexpr/branch/master)

**Jexpr** is an experimental expression engine that creates javascript code from custom definitions to evaluate expressions. It uses [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint "Javascript Interpreter for .NET") and [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash "A JavaScript utility library delivering consistency, modularity, performance, & extras.") internally.
